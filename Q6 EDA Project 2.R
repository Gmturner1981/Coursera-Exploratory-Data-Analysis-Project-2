## Question 6:

## Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources
## in Baltimore City with emissions from motor
## vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California
## (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen great
## r changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

sub4 <- subset(NEI, fips == "06037" & type=="ON-ROAD")

lamot.sources <- aggregate(sub4[c("Emissions")], list(type = sub4$type, year = sub4$year, zip = sub4$fips), sum)

comp.mv <- rbind(baltmot.sources, lamot.sources)

qplot(year, Emissions, data = comp.mv, color = zip, geom= "line", ylim = c(-100, 5500)) + ggtitle("Motor Vehicle Emissions in Baltimore (24510) \nvs. Los Angeles (06037) Counties") + xlab("Year") + ylab("Emission Levels")
